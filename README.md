The automatic cornhole scoring system tracks the cornhole bags to automatically score and display the game results in a standard game of cornhole.
The codes in this repository are the portions of the system that I created from scratch or worked off a team's initial concept.
I mostly prioritized the IN-THE-HOLE scoring which included the a color sensor.
  The idea was to potentially use 3 color sensors but it resulted going back to one as we had difficulties having 2 work accordingly.
Once the color sensor code was finished, I implemented it into the scoreboard codebase that my teammate created.
Afterwards I worked on the Bluetooth communication with the HC-05 module so that both boards can communicate with eachother.
